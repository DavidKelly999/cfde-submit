# CFDE-Submit

The `cfde-submit` tool is a product of the NIH [Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE)](https://www.nih-cfde.org/) Coordinating Center (CFDE-CC).

This lightweight command-line tool enables an authorized NIH Common Fund Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to submit a C2M2 instance to CFDE-CC so the DCC's data holdings can be included in the CFDE Portal.

The `cfde-submit` tool works with the CFDE Portal and cannot be used with other systems. Its use is authorized by the CFDE-CC team: only authorized individuals may submit C2M2 instances using `cfde-submit`. See the Getting Started section for information about obtaining authorization.
